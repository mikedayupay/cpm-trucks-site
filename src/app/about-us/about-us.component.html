        Since 1981, Mr. Carlos D. Chua has been setting a tradition of excellence in the trucking industry, both as supplier/importer
        of all kinds of trucks and other special purpose and commercial vehicles, and as hauler and trucker.
      </p>
      <p>
        As one of the biggest dealers of cement, he owned and maintained fifty (50) hauler-trucks, which regularly carried and hauled
        from the Northern Cement Corporation depot to various destination points in Luzon. For this purpose, the Carlo Martin
        Cement Marketing Corporation was formed and established by Mr. Carlos Chua.

        As importer and supplier of all kinds of trucks and other special purpose and commercial vehicles, Central Pacific was formed
        and established by Mr. Chua. It remains to be one of the most reputable and reliable suppliers of trucks in Metro
        Manila.
